# old-website-designs
Here are the files for my previous website designs.  Note that the very first few designs (which were bad in general) have not been included.  The first version to be archived is the layout built on Baseline v2.0.3.  N.B.  Please note that the website files may not work properly due to the URLs (you will know what I mean if you understand HTML).
